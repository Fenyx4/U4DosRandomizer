Special thanks to [Squibbons](https://www.twitch.tv/squibbons) and [Gilmok](https://github.com/Gilmok) for getting me into this stuff
and to cambragol for testing, helping me compile the U4 code and delving into the code with me on so many occasions.

Thanks to the testers

And thank you ergonomy-joe for decompiling the U4 code. I could not have done this without it.
