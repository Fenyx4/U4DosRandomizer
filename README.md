# U4DosRandomizer
Randomizer for Ultima IV

Requires Ultima IV which is available for free at https://www.gog.com/game/ultima_4.

1. Download the randomizer from https://github.com/Fenyx4/U4DosRandomizer/releases
1. Unzip and drop the executable in the Ultima IV directory (same folder as the WORLD.MAP file)
1. Run the executable

All the files the randomizer changes get backed up with the extension ".orig" added. There is no way to quickly revert to those original files (yet). To revert you'll have to rename them or reinstall the game.
